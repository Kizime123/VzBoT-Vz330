The Vz-printhead has moved Repos. 
If you are looking for the Printed version: https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead-Printed/tree/main/STLs
If you are looking for the metal version: https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead-CNC/tree/main/STLs
Disclaimer: Please note that the metal parts are work of the Vzbot team. To ensure quality components and further funding of our project, we do not offer these parts as CAD files.

The Print head is a modified EVA carriage to fit the VzBoT. The EVA project is owned and maintained by Pawel. Big thanks and credits to the man behind this.
